  <p>The type of color scheme I am using is monochromatic and a little bit of analogous. The emotion I am trying to elicit from the webpage veiwer is warmth and the feeling of Autumn. this is because in my opinion, these colors resemble feeling you get when you are at home and it is Autumn and it is raining, and you have the fire-place on. That's waht I think the colors resemble. </p>
